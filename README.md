# unit-4-game

# Description
This is a simple game where the user has four characters (buttons) to choose from the match the pre-defined random score. Each button holds a different randomized value that, when added up, should equal the starting number to win. 

# Languages Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery

# Composition
Game title/instructions, area for randomized Battle Number, area for tracking user number, area for score-keeping wins and loses, 4 character buttons, each with randomized values for each round.

# Takeaways
I learned a lot from the previous assignment and made progress with thinking through a game application for this one. I was able to logically think through the steps necessary to create a fully working game that the user would be able to understand and verify it's consistency with the instructions. Compared to my previous homework, this was a huge step forward (even with this assignment being the easier version) in my comprehension of Javascript/jQuery fundamentals.

# Feedback
I would like to bounce suggestions on how to condense the code even more. It all works smoothly, but in terms of length I believe my code could be even more condensed. Otherwise, no huge blockers from this assignment.
